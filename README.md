# LinuxTask-2

- Create a Linux shell script that performs the following tasks:
    1. Automatically detects the OS architecture like Ubuntu or RHEL and installs MySQL accordingly.
    2. Creates a database named "test" and a table within it, and inserts some information.
    3. Takes a backup of the "test" database.
    4. Creates a tar file of the backup and stores it in the **`/tmp`** directory.
    5. Also create a cron job to run backup scripts(that you created for task 1) every day at 10 PM.
